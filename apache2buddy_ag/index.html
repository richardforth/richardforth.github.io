                    If you're new to apache2buddy.pl, in order to really understand the evolution of the script that we know and love today, we have to first go back and meet the grandfather of apache tuning, <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong>.

                <p class="main-text">
                    <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong> was originally a collaborative project by several Rackspace employees, and was originally built specifically to support <strong>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong> systems. It has always been an open source project so it wasn't restricted to internal use at the Rack (so this isn't just an internal tool - its used by people all over the world), however, it was, shall we say <em>mainly</em> used by Rackspace employees to provide support to our customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Systems and the Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack. Without revealing too much in terms of Intellectual Property or internal processes of Rackspace, we have to acknowledge it's birthplace to get a true grip on the factors that influenced it's development.

                <p class="main-text">
                    In apachebuddy.pl's hey-day, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) was the <em>only</em> available operating system we sold / supported on the Linux support floor, so of course it made sense to code apachebuddy.pl accordingly, this may go some way to explain the difference in the size of the code base of apachebuddy.pl when we compare it with apache2buddy.pl (see Fig 1), since it was only written to cater to RHEL systems:

                    Of course that was 5+ years ago now and times move on, a need arose for further support, as support in the Linux Department expanded to cater mainly for Ubuntu and Debian systems, in addition to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and it's open source cousin, CentOS. However the apachebuddy project was abandoned by that point and is no longer maintained, but was kept on a external facing github account and has the domain "apachebuddy.pl".

                    The idea behind the domain pointing at the raw code was to allow one to run <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong> through a commandline process known as "curl and perl", where you curl the domain and pipe it into perl (see Fig 2):

                    It's important to note that no one maintains apachebuddy.pl, it is an abandoned project that is hosted for posterity reasons. Some people still use it, but many people have now started using apache2buddy.pl instead, so lets find out why....

            <p class="main-text">The .pl dns top level domain is indeed Polish. However, it is (probably not in the spirit of the IETF/IANA but hey, people are people) used (possibly inappropriately but from a tech point-of-view is a stroke of genius) to host perl scripts because they also happen to share the same file extension (.pl). As a thank you to the polish people I may one day translate this page in to polish! #challengemuch #przepraszam</p>
            <p class="main-text">One of the most iconic examples of these domains is the <a href="http://mysqltuner.pl" target="_blank">MySQLTuner project</a>, looked after by Major Hayden. mysqltuner is hosted on the mysqltuner.pl domain.

                <h2>Introduction to apache2buddy. How I got involved.</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="main-text">I spoke to Will Parsons who hosts the project on <a href="https://github.com/will-parsons">his github account</a>, about 5 years ago (circa 2013-14), asking him if there were any plans to update it to support Debian and Ubuntu Systems.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I was told that the code wasn't actually his, and that it was no longer being maintained anyway, and he had no plans to make any updates to apachebuddy.pl.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I asked him if he didnt mind if I took a copy of it and forked it into a new project, to see what I could do to solve the problems with it not running on Debian or Ubuntu Systems.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I say "fork" here loosely, as at that time I had no github/git training or knowledge, so I copied the code into a vim editor and originally hosted the apache2buddy project and its associated domain on a LAMP server running in the cloud. I editted the file manually eacg tiime it needed updating, and had no change control or proper backups in place.</p>
            <p class="main-text">This, as you can imagine, wasnt very easy to maintain, but, over time I grew to learn and adopt git/github repositories and learnt how to commit changes, slowly over time I migrated away from a LAMP server to hosting the code on my own github repository:</p>

            <p class="figtext">Fig 4: The home of apache2buddy.pl</p>
            <p class="main-text">Originally I had the domain <strong>apache2buddy.pl</strong> pointed to the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl" target="_blank">raw code</a>, just like Will did with the original <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong>domain (see <a href="#fig5">curl and perl method</a>).</p>
            <p class="main-text">However I got itchy feet and a tick in my face whenever I gave any thought to the fact that the <a href="#fig5">curl and perl method</a> was open to malicious bad actors typocamping/typosquatting <sup>[<a href="#biblio2">2</a>][<a href="#biblio3">3</a>]</sup> on slightly mispelled domains. It kept me up at night that this also had to be done as root, on systems globally. Even though I knew I wasn't really responsible for end users doing something silly like curling and mistyping a domain name, and then piping that into perl, as root (and enabling some bad actor which maybe registered a mis-spelt version of the apache2buddy.pl domain in the hope they catch a fish with a malicious root compromise perl script or bitcoin miner or something equally unwelcome).</p>
            <p class="main-text">So to that end I pointed the domain away from the code and forced people who still wished to curl and perl, use the whole complete github path to the raw code, since it was much more difficult to land in hot water due to a mistyped URL:
            <div class="codeblock"  id="fig5"># curl -sL apache2buddy.pl | perl</div>
            <p class="figtext">Fig5: The curl and perl method we ran originally. This no longer works, you will get errors.</p>
            <div class="codeblock"># curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl | perl</div>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 6: The curl and perl method we run today.</p>
            <p class="main-text">While the first example looks more aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and is easy to remember, as commands go, it was vulnerable to a typosquatting attack, consider the following BAD command (trigger warning - I have no idea if that domain is registered and if it has a malicious perl code behind it - it's just an example to illustrate what I mean by typo-squatting attacks).
            <div class="codeblock"># curl -sL apache2budddy.pl | perl</div>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 7: An example of a mistyped domain in a command that could run other, potentially arbitraryor malicious perl code (as root).</p>
            <p class="main-text">Did you notice in Figure 7 that there were three d's in this last example? Suppose someone wrote a bad perl script and you mistyped the domain as above.... well, through your own fat, sausage fingers, you now <em>potentiially</em> aided in a third party root compromising your server. Slow clap...</p>
            <p class="main-text">Though I could never take responsibility for your own faux pas, I decided to no longer support using the domain name as part of the curl and perl technique as a saftey precaution, and so repointed it  - originally to a blog, then to this page (you get some random perl errors because perl would try to parse HTML).</p>
            <p class="main-text">For about a year during the transition amd before I finally pointed the domain to a wordpress blog, effectively breaking it, I first created a simple perl script that printed a public service announcement on the terminal window, advising them that the new method was as per Fig 5 (above), and that eventually curling the domain and piping it into perl would not work, and pointed the domain to that.<sup>[ reference needed ]</sup></p>
            <p class="main-text">That pretty much brings you up to speed on how apache2buddy.pl came to be, and how I got involved, without delving too deep into code, but don't be fooled - I'm breaking you in gently...</p>

            <p class="main-text">The original <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong> had a couple of major shortcomings.

            <p class="main-text">Secondly, but more pressingly at the time, the main issue was that <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong> only worked on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, it didn't run on Ubuntu or Debian systems* which came into support at Rackspace around 5 years ago, a solution had to be found.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Here we see a successful run on a CentOS 6.10 machine. But since it doesnt run on CentOS 7, its quickly becoming less functional. Note also how it has calculated a maxclients value based on 990MB of RAM and a largest proces size of 4.74 MB of memory. This is a fairly rudimentary calculation that doesn't consider any other running services on the system that might consume memory. So the recommendation based on total installed RAM is of limited value, what we need is a calculation based on remaining RAM after key services have been taken into consideration.</p>
            <p class="main-text"> Though it seems like I might be just completely dismissive of apachebuddy.pl, I actually owe it a ton of respect, like a village elder, as <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong> is the forefather of apache2buddy.pl, which builds upon the foundations laid down by <strong>apachebuddy.pl</strong> originally.

            <h2>Supported Operating Systems</h2>
            <p class="main-text">These are the operating systems that are OFFICIALLY supported.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</li>
                <li>CentOS.</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="main-text">Note that it may run just fine on others, but that would be a fluke and not by any design. Support follows as much as possible, the original OS lifecycle dates (ie, when the vendor EOLs the OS, I remove it from apache2buddy support. The script will NOT run on EOL systems.</p>
            <p class="main-text">But, I hear you say, what if I have a business need to run old cruddy hardware and unpatched systems? Or what if my OS isn't supported by apache2buddy.pl? How can I force it to run?.</p>

            <h2>What do I do if my OS isnt listed under "Supported Operating Systems"?</h2>
            <p class="main-text">Welome to the world of Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS). I have had many requests to add support for other operating systems, and the answer has always been no, and it always will be.</p>
            <p class="main-text">But, I am not a monster. Here are some high-level suggestions on how I would recommend you proceed. We can deep dive into each option as required:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fork the project on github. Make your own custom changes to the script.</li>
                <li>Download or git-clone the repo locally and just do a one-time edit to make it run.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main-text">At the end of the day, I can only do so much testing, and I chose, for my own sanity, to only support the big four OSes, Debian, and its most famous branch-off - Ubuntu, and of course RHEL, and the two other major distros based on that CentOS and Scientific.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I have never prevented anyone from hacking their own private version of the script, so long as they adhere to the spirit of the Apache 2.0 License.</p>
            <p class="main-text">So lets go on a journey of discovery as I walk you through a fictional scenario: we are going to fudge apache2buddy to run on an unsupported OS Version.</p>
            <h3>The Dilemma</h3>
            <p class="main-text">You have a requirement to tune apache on a CloudLinux 7 machine, but apache2buddy exits with an error stating that it only currently supports a certain list of RED Hat based OSes, but we know that CloudLinux is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
            <h3>The Proposition / Solution</h3>
            <p class="main-text">We are going to download the code locally with wget, and then hack the perl script and make some changes, and try to execute it again.</p>
            <h3>Begin...</h3>
            <p class="main-text">Our first job is to download the perlscript locally, lets save it to root's home area, /root</p>
            <p class="codeblock"># wget -O /root/apache2buddy.pl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/master/apache2buddy.pl</p>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 8: Saving the script locally with wget.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Before we proceed further, I do want to talk a bit about editors. Honestly its up to you what editor you use, if it's nano, a small kitten dies so lets avoid that, just kidding. I recommend that you use an editor that allows you to quickly and easily identify line numbers, and it must be a command-line editor (the assumption here is your production servers arent running a GUI (though seriously one time I found a rackmounted server running X windows and gnome-screensaver....take as long as you need on that one...</p>
            <p class="main-text">Anyway the point I am getting at is that in these examples I will be walking you through the edits with vi/vim, and using line numbers that made sense as of this writing, but as you know time stands still for no man and, well, line numbers may not be the same in a few years time. Its still an active project.</p>
            <p class="main-text">So if I say, on line 80 change this value to that value, and the line i am quoting loks nothing like the line 80 youre working on, have a look in that general area of the code, as things get added or removed, teh code I may have been referring to may not be on line 80 any more, but it won't have drifted too far I would'nt have thought. Use your noggin before you complain.</p>
            <p class="main-text">So, if you havent already, make sure you have the following in your <strong>.vimrc</strong> file in root's home as a minimum:</p>
            <p class="codeblock">set number</p>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 9: Setting line numbers in vim using a runtime config file /root/.vimrc</p>
            <p class="main-text">Now edit the file:</p>
            <p class="codeblock"># vim /root/apache2buddy.pl</p>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 10: Opening up apache2buddy.pl in the vim editor.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Next, we go to line 337 and heed the warning, you can either scroll down untill you get to line 337 or press ESC and then type:</p>
            <p class="codeblock">337g</p>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 11: Moving quickly to line 337 in the vim editor.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Observe the warning in the comments:</p>
            <p class="codeblock"># Please dont make pull requests to add your distro to this list, that doesnt make it supported.
# The following distros are what I use to test and deploy apache2buddy and only these distro's are supported.</p>
            <p class="figtext">Fig 12: Comments save lives, always read comments.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Add "CloudLinux" to the list of supported Oses:</p>
            <p class="codeblock">my @supported_os_list = ('Ubuntu',

            <p class="figtext">Fig 14: Moving quickly to line 360 in the vim editor.</p>

            <p class="main-text">I know what youre thinking; this was way too easy, why dont I just add support for cloudlinux and be done with it.</p>

            <p class ="main-text">I have even added a <strong>--skip-os-version-check</strong> option to make it even easier to execute:</p>

                                      skipping the os version check is not recommended as features may be 
                                      deprecated or removed and apache2buddy is not backward compatible 
                                      with end of life operating systems, this may cause errors and unpredictable 
                                      behaviour.</mark>

            <p class ="main-text">The method I outlined here will get you so far, but you may have to fix other errors that crop up as you'll be running apache2buddy.pl in unknown territory. The above edits may or may not allow the script to run to completion.</p>
            <p class="main-text">If you are a really competent perl / python coder, you can do what <strong>psytester</strong> did and submit a pull request to add OS support, which <strong>psytester</strong> did to add support to SuSE Linux systems, I merged <strong>psytester</strong>'s changes <a href="https://github.com/richardforth/apache2buddy/pull/284/commits/cf48b9edae37745c35b305ff59cc1198854f878d" target="_blank">here</a>, but note that I haven't acknowledged that SuSE is a Supported OS as I do not have the capability or capacity to test against SuSE systems. If it works, then great, if it does'nt, one hopes that <strong>psytester</strong> will submit further pull requests in the future to maintain support for SuSE.</p>

            <h2>Best practices when working with apache2buddy.pl</h2>
            <h4>"Anyone can swing a sword, but only the Samurai know how to truly handle it with grace and skill."</h4>
            <p class="main-text">Let's deal with the elephant in the room: apache2buddy.pl produces a LOT of output, and it is <em>NOT</em> designed to be the club with which you beat your customers over the head.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Think of it like a dashboard, or a fighter-pilot's HUD (Heads Up Display), so that you, the discerning System Administrator, can use the information to help you come to a business decision and use <em>PARTS</em> of the output, to help your case when influencing others, be they a customer in a support ticket, your technical director, server teams, management, or other invested parties.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I can categorically affirm that it was <em>not</em> built to be user friendly or customer-facing - it's a <em>technical tool</em> for <em>technical people</em>. That's not to say that technically minded end-users are forbidden from running it, but if you as a Systems Admnistrator are slapping your non-technical customers with the full output from apache2buddy.pl, or even apachebuddy.pl - like the Hammer of Thor - then you're not using it correctly.</p>
            <p class="main-text">In the next section we will learn how to get, execute, and run the script, as well as how to interpret the results and present your case in your own words, appropriately, using small snippets of output to highlight certain facts. At the end of that section, I will do a fake update/email/ticket that shows best practice in using apache2buddy findings <em>effectively</em> in your communications.</p>

I will finish up with an example update to a customer using apache2buddy as my guide and reference point.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Before we break it down, let's take a look as a full execution run output. We can then take some time to break each section down for discussion.</p>
